    <h1>Arsenal History</h1>
    <h2>Club History:</h2>

      <p>
        The Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in
        Islington, North London, England. They compete in the Premier League,
        the top tier of English football. In domestic football, Arsenal have won
        13 league titles <b>(including one unbeaten title)</b>, a record
        <b>14 FA Cups</b>, 2 League Cups, 17 FA Community Shields and a Football
        League Centenary Trophy. In European football, they have won
        <b>one European Cup Winners' Cup and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</b>. In
        terms of trophies won, it is the third-most successful club in English
        football.[2] Arsenal was the first club from southern England to join
        the Football League in 1893, officially joining the First Division in
        1904. Arsenal carries the longest active streak continuously in the top
        division (over 105 years and counting) & completed the 20th century with
        the highest average league position of any club.[3][4] Arsenal has won
        the second-most top-flight matches in English football history.[5] In
        the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, with
        another FA Cup and two more Championships coming after the war. In
        1970–71, it won its first League and FA Cup double. Between 1989 and
        2005, the club won five league titles and five FA Cups, including two
        more doubles. Between 1998 and 2017, Arsenal qualified for the UEFA
        Champions League for an English football record nineteen consecutive
        seasons.[6] In 1886, munitions workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich
        founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to
        Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham
        Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. Herbert Chapman won the
        club its first silverware, and his legacy enabled a trophy-laden period
        in the 1930s. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and
        shirt numbers;[7] he also added the white sleeves and brighter red to
        the club's jersey.[8] Arsène Wenger was the club's longest-serving
        manager and won the most trophies. He won a record seven FA Cups, and
        his third and final title-winning team set an English record for the
        longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and
        2004, receiving the nickname The Invincibles. In 2006, the club moved to
        the nearby Emirates Stadium. With an annual revenue of £616.6m in the
        2023–24 season[9], Arsenal was estimated to be worth US$3.4 billion by
        Forbes, making it the world's eighth-most valuable football club,[10]
        while also being one of the most followed sport teams in the world on
        social media.[11] The motto of the club is Victoria Concordia Crescit,
        Latin for "Victory Through Harmony".
